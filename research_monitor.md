# Microsoft Security Weekly Monitoring System

## Purpose
Automated weekly monitoring of Microsoft security product announcements, filtering out patches, KB articles, and content outside specified date ranges.

## Trigger Phrases
- "weekly update"
- "MS security scan"
- "scan last week"
- Or provide specific date range: "scan October 12-19, 2025"

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Execute Google Dork Searches
Run these 4 searches with date operators [after:DATE-1 before:DATE+1]:

#### 1. Feature Announcements
```
site:microsoft.com (Defender OR Sentinel OR Purview OR "Entra ID") after:[DATE-1] before:[DATE+1] (announcing OR released OR preview OR "now available") -KB -patch -cumulative -"annual report" -"quarterly report" -"digital defense report"
```

#### 2. Security Blog
```
site:microsoft.com/security/blog after:[DATE-1] before:[DATE+1] -KB
```

#### 3. Documentation Updates
```
site:learn.microsoft.com (Defender OR Sentinel OR Purview) after:[DATE-1] before:[DATE+1] inurl:whats-new
```

#### 4. TechCommunity Posts
```
site:techcommunity.microsoft.com security after:[DATE-1] before:[DATE+1] -KB -patch
```

### Step 2: Check RSS Feeds
Monitor these 19 RSS feeds for articles within date range:

#### Primary Feeds
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/feed/
- https://www.microsoft.com/releasecommunications/api/v2/azure/rss

#### TechCommunity Boards

- https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/rss/board?board.id=MicrosoftDefenderforOffice365Blog

### Step 3: Filtering Rules

#### EXCLUDE (Must filter out)
- KB articles
- Patch Tuesday updates
- Cumulative updates
- Annual/quarterly reports (e.g., Digital Defense Report)
- PDF-only releases
- Monthly summary posts discussing older announcements
- Any content with publication date outside specified range

#### INCLUDE (Must include)
- New feature announcements
- Public preview releases
- General availability (GA) announcements
- Major security advisories (non-patch)
- Architecture/capability changes
- Pricing/licensing changes affecting security products

#### CRITICAL DATE VERIFICATION
- Check article metadata for actual publication date
- Ignore "age" indicators like "3 weeks ago" unless they fall within range
- If article metadata shows date outside range â†’ EXCLUDE completely
- Only include items where feature/announcement was PUBLISHED in specified date range

### Step 4: Output Format
```markdown
## Microsoft Security Weekly Update: [DATE RANGE]

[If no results found, state: "No new announcements found for [date range]"]

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too many results
**Solution**: Verify date filtering is working correctly. Check that monthly summary posts are being excluded.

### Issue: Missing known announcements
**Solution**: 
1. Verify announcement was published in date range (not just discussed)
2. Check if announcement source is in RSS feed list
3. Verify Google Dork operators are current

### Issue: False positives (patches included)
**Solution**: Update exclusion filters in Step 3 to catch new patch naming patterns

### Issue: RSS feeds not accessible
**Solution**: Verify TechCommunity feed URLs haven't changed format. Microsoft occasionally updates their community platform structure.

## Appendix B: Alternative Search Methods

### Using Microsoft Graph API (Future Enhancement)
If direct API access becomes available, consider these endpoints:
- Microsoft 365 Message Center API
- Microsoft Learn API
- TechCommunity API (if available)

### Using Third-Party Aggregators
Consider supplementing with:
- RSS aggregator services (Feedly, Inoreader)
- Security news aggregators
- Microsoft MVP blogs

---

## Appendix C: Monitoring Gaps

### Known Limitations
1. Google search operators limited to 10 queries per minute
2. RSS feeds may have delays (up to 24 hours)
3. Some Microsoft announcements occur outside standard channels (Twitter, LinkedIn)
4. Private previews not publicly announced
5. Regional announcements may be missed

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add Microsoft 365 Roadmap monitoring
- [ ] Include Azure Updates RSS feed filtering
- [ ] Monitor Microsoft MVP blog aggregator
- [ ] Add webhook integration for real-time alerts
- [ ] Create automated GitHub Actions workflow
